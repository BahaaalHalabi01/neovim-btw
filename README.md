# _I use neovim by the way_

After My first take at creating a neovim config from scratch, inspired by **ThePrimeagen**,**TJ DeVries** channels, and others on youtube. I had a **great** initial time with neovim. using a previous [config](https://github.com/BahaaalHalabi01/init.lua) for sometime, and improving it with understanding how neovim works.

I ended up with this.
